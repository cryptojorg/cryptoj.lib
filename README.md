# cryptoj.lib

## Purpose
Java Crypto Library for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Iota and more

The goal of this library is to provide a unified API to create and use paper wallets for different crypto currencies.

This repository also provides a sample application to demonstrate the usage of the provided API. So far the following currencies are supported 

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Iota

##Â Warning/Current Status

This library and the demo application are currently experimental/educational only. 
No testing with real funds has taken place.

## Run the Application

After cloning this repo build the command line tool using Maven.

```
mvn clean package
```

The result of the Maven build is an executable JAR file.

### Creating Paper Wallets

Use the following command to create a paper wallet. For the example we will create a Bitcoin wallet.

```
java -jar target/cryptoj-lib-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -d . -p "test pass phrase" -t bitcoin```
```

This will lead to an output similar to the one below

```
writing wallet file ...
writing html and png output files ...
files successfully written to directory
wallet file: ./1EQVGkJN6V8QdZ3ANsnXCHmhZRnnxL7Kx1.json
protocol: Bitcoin (Production)
address: 1EQVGkJN6V8QdZ3ANsnXCHmhZRnnxL7Kx1
encrypted: true
pass phrase: test pass phrase
seed: expose dwarf coyote broken alert rifle fade novel estate output about repair
```

Three files have been created

* A HTML file for printing (1EQVGkJN6V8QdZ3ANsnXCHmhZRnnxL7Kx1.html)
* The actual wallet file (1EQVGkJN6V8QdZ3ANsnXCHmhZRnnxL7Kx1.json)
* The corresponding address as QR code (1EQVGkJN6V8QdZ3ANsnXCHmhZRnnxL7Kx1.png)

An HTML output looks as shown  below.

Using the created seed phrase "expose dwarf coyote broken alert rifle fade novel estate output about repair" may be used to restore the wallet with Electrum Bitcoin wallet.

Using the Electrum wallet this leads to the same receive address as provided by the command line tool.
